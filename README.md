# Robotics Calibration Opencat

This repository is dedicated to guiding users through the calibration process for the Opencat robotic cat. Calibration is crucial to ensure that the robotic movements are smooth and stable. This guide includes steps to adjust the servo motors and fine-tune the robot's balance and gait.

## Prerequisites

- A fully assembled Opencat robot with servo motors installed
- Arduino IDE
- Servo calibration software or scripts

## Installation

### Software Setup

1. Install the Arduino IDE from the [official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Download the servo calibration sketch provided in this repository.

## Calibration Process

### Servo Calibration

1. Connect the Arduino to your computer.
2. Upload the servo calibration sketch to the Arduino.
3. Adjust the servo positions using the serial monitor commands to find the optimal alignment for each joint.

### Gait Tuning

After servo calibration, the robot's walking gait may need adjustments to improve stability and efficiency.

```cpp
// Sample Arduino code to adjust gait parameters
void adjustGaitParameters() {
    // Example function to adjust gait parameters
    setStrideLength(15);  // Set the stride length in mm
    setStrideHeight(5);   // Set the stride height in mm
    setWalkingSpeed(10);  // Set the walking speed in cm/s
}
```

## Testing and Validation

Once the calibration is complete, conduct a series of tests to validate the robot's movement:

- Test walking on different surfaces.
- Test responsiveness to control commands.
- Adjust as necessary based on test results.
